# ðŸ“šCollege Project

This project is part of my programming studies. It's not originally mine**, but I made a few modifications to improve and personalize it.

## ðŸš€ Features Added

- Recreated using Bootstrap for better layout structure  
- Font Awesome integrated to give it a more professional look, similar to a real news website

It's one of my favorite websites developed, therewise I pretend to give some special attention to improve it as my personal project
